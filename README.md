# liri-node-app
In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

# Search Spotify for songs
The spotify-this-song command uses the Spotify API and the node-spotify-api package to return information about the song provided by the user. Unfortunately, this section of the app is not working as intended as searches tend to give back songs relatded or close to the search but not exactly the correct song. Im currently in the proccess of finding a solution to this.
